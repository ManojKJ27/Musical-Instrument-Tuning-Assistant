# Musical-Instrument-Tuning-Assistant : Program execution guide
Final year Capstone Project;
Guide : Dr.Venkatarangan
Team : Manoj, Vamshi, Abhijith

# Features:
- INPUT : 
  1. MODE:  
   a. Pitch Detection: Detects the pitch of the sound generated by the Instrument.  
   b. Digital Tanpura: Generates the sound of INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE specified by the User. 
  2. TARGET PITCH:  
    - Pitch (/frequency) at which user wants to play the Music. 
  3. INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE 
  4. AUDIO FROM THE INSTRUMENT
- OUTPUT
  1. Target pitch and real time pitch accuracy display on the LCD. 
  2. Syntzhesized Sound will be played from the Speaker to tune the specified user Instrument. 
 
# Algorithm: 
- Audio I/O 
- Signal-to-Noise ratio estimation 
- Pitch contour generation (and plotting, if needed) 
- Initial pitch estimate 
- Denoising pitch contour to remove abrupt variations 
- Denoising the pitch contour generated based on initial pitch estimate 
- Histogram (/group counts) calculation 
- Extracting the resulting pitch 
- Providing the information about the corrective action to be taken
 
# File to be executed : main.py

# Libraries :
