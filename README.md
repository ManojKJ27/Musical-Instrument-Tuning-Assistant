# Musical-Instrument-Tuning-Assistant
Final year Capstone Project

# General Overview:  
- INPUT : 
  1. MODE:  
   a. Pitch Detection: Detects the pitch of the sound generated by the Instrument.  
   b. Digital Tanpura: Generates the sound of INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE specified by the User. 
  2. TARGET PITCH:  
    - Pitch (/frequency) at which user wants to play the Music. 
  3. INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE 
  4. AUDIO FROM THE INSTRUMENT
- OUTPUT
  1. Target pitch and real time pitch accuracy display on the LCD. 
  2. Syntzhesized Sound will be played from the Speaker to tune the specified user Instrument. 
 
# Algorithm: 
- Audio I/O 
- Signal-to-Noise ratio estimation 
- Pitch contour generation (and plotting, if needed) 
- Denoising pitch contour to remove abrupt variations 
- Initial pitch estimate 
- Denoising the pitch contour generated based on initial pitch estimate 
- Histogram (/group counts) calculation 
- Extracting the resulting pitch 
 
# Progress:  
- Pitch detection framework is ready (in Python and MATLAB) 
  - Audio I/O 
  - Signal-to-Noise ratio estimation 
  - Pitch contour generation (and plotting, if needed) 
  - Denoising the pitch contour generated  
  - Histogram (/group counts) calculation 
  - Extracting the resulting pitch 
- Real-time pitch detection framework is ready in MATLAB 
 
# Challenges:  
- The execution time (on average) is 3~4 seconds for 1s of audio input. This would really make it difficult for real time implementation. 
- The SNR calculation is not clear (unlike MATLAB) 
- On average the pitch estimate has a deviation from ideal result of about 1Hz. Though small, we want to reduce this error. 
- Identifying different Octaves and Swaras (Sa, Pa, Sa#)
