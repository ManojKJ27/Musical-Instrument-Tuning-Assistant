# Musical-Instrument-Tuning-Assistant
Final year Capstone Project
General Overview:  
INPUT 
MODE:  
Input method: using Push buttons (toggle b/w a and b modes) 
Pitch Detection: Detects the pitch of the sound generated by the Instrument.  
Digital Tanpura: Generates the sound of INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE specified by the User. 
TARGET PITCH:  
Input method: Using a Keypad 
Target pitch at which user what to play the Music. 
INSTRUMENT OF CHOICE:  
 Input method: using Push buttons (toggle b/w a, b and c instruments) 
Veena 
Flute 
Violin 
AUDIO FROM THE INSTRUMENT: Records the Music from the Instrument in Real-Time and Analyses for detecting the Pitch. 
OUTPUTS 
Target pitch and real time pitch accuracy display on the LCD. 
Synthesized Sound will be played from the Speaker to tune the specified user Instrument. 
 
Algorithm: 
Audio I/O 
Signal-to-Noise ratio estimation 
Pitch contour generation (and plotting, if needed) 
Denoising pitch contour to remove abrupt variations 
Initial pitch estimate 
Denoising the pitch contour generated based on initial pitch estimate 
Histogram (/group counts) calculation 
Extracting the resulting pitch 
 
Progress:  
Pitch detection framework is ready (in Python and MATLAB)

Real-time pitch detection framework is ready in MATLAB 
 
Challenges:  
The execution time (on average) is 3~4 seconds for 1s of audio input. This would really make it difficult for real time implementation. 
The SNR calculation is not clear (unlike MATLAB) 
On average the pitch estimate has a deviation from ideal result of about 1Hz. Though small, we want to reduce this error.
